# üìÖ 40-Day Learning Plan ‚Äì Spring Framework with Kotlin

This is my personal 40-day challenge to learn and document the Spring Framework using Kotlin and PostgreSQL.  
Each day includes a README with a short summary, one or more classes, and corresponding tests ‚Äì without using Mockito.
Short periodic lessons for working on habits

## üîÅ Notes

- All examples will be written in Kotlin using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
- Tests will use JUnit 5 and MockMvc ‚Äì without using Mockito.
- Each folder `dayXX-topic` contains source code and `README.md`.
